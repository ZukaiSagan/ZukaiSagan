## Hello, this github account is a work in progress as I migrate some of my public-facing work here.


I'm a Junior Computer Science student specializing in full stack software engineering in addition to ML Applications and Research.

Some of my past roles include:
Microsoft SWE Intern working with Agentic AI frameworks
SeedAI Software Designer implementing lab-made neural nets into an accessible web application
Full Stack SWE SLU Research Experience for Undergrads working on creating a site for the National Science Foundation
NASA and MO Space Grant Consortium ML Research Intern working on data processing and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks


I'm currently working on my creating my own VPN, which I'll share more about at the link below.
